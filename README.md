Currently the project is predicting what type of outfit a user loads into the closet store, or has already loaded.

From here this new information needs to be taken into account in the following ways:
    -Calculate the number of items in each "fashion category" a user has in their closet.
    -Recommend brands/places for further research.
    -Show random images from Unsplash of the various categories within their closet for further inspiration.

Further dowm the line I would like to add outfit recommendations using individual elements from an outfit without any extra work from the user.

Perform General cleanup of the UI. Make it look like a nice and professional application.
